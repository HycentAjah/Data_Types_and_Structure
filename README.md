# Data_Types_and_Structure
This notebook showcase a simple manipulation of basic data types and structures using Python. Specifically, the notebook contains 2 tasks.

# Task 1 covers:
1. Reading the 2 dataset from my home directory to python dataframe.
2. Joining the 2 dataset to a single dataframe  
3. Selecting the variables of interest for analysis into a another dataframe.
4. Checking the data type of the variables of interest and ensuring they are of the right type.
5. Checking the details of the new dataframe, including checks for missing data and data format, long or wide.
6. Transforming the Answer from long to wide if necessary.

# Task 2 covers:
1. Loadin a data object x into the notebook.
2. Extract from list x, the 1 and 0 and storing them in their boolean form in a separate list.
3. Extract from list x, the colours and storing them in their  string data type form in a separate list.
4. Extract from list x, the years, and storing them as a integer data type in a separate list.
5. Extract from list x, the float (decimal values), and storing them as float data type in a separate list.
6. Converting the resulting 4 list from above into a Dictionary data structure
7. Converting the Dictionary into a data frame with 4 columns each containing the different data type in a more structured form than originally presented.
